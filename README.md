# NumMathII-HW

This repository contains the programming homework exercises I did during the 2021/22 winter term for the numerical mathematics II lecture at the Technical University of Berlin.

This lecture was about numerical methods for solving partial differential equations, specifically, it covered FD and FE methods. Additionally, some linear solver theory was studied.

Everything here is written in Julia, and contained in either a pluto notebook (https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) or a simple Julia script.

If you stumble upon this repository, I hope you find it intersting.
